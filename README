stockChecker is a simple app to fetch the price of specified stocks and
sends them in an SMS message.  It is intended to be run via cron after
the stock markets close to get succinct daily update.  This effort is a
way to learn Python better and use API integrations.

Stock prices are checked using AlphaVantage.com, and SMS messages sent
using Twilio.
